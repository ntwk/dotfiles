# tmux-neww-here - Open a tmux window in session 0
#
# USAGE: tmux-neww-here [DIRECTORY]
#
# tmux-neww-here will open a new tmux window in the present working directory
# or DIRECTORY if specified.
#
# tmux-neww-here is similar to the tmux 'new-window' command except that it
# always targets session '0' as defined in tmux-launch.  Additionally, the
# target session is brought to the foreground and given focus.
#
# When outside of an X environment (i.e. DISPLAY is unset) tmux-neww-here will
# instead open a new window in the currently attached session if it exists or
# fail otherwise.  This can be useful when remotely attached to a tmux session
# via SSH.
#
# This command was previously known as 'tmux-thunar' and was originally meant
# to be invoked via a Thunar custom action but it has proven to be useful in
# other contexts or simply called directly.
